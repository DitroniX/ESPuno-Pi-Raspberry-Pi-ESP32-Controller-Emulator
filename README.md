# ESPuno-Pi-Raspberry-Pi-ESP32-Controller-Emulator

**ESPuno Pi** a new STEM board for Q1 2025, incorporating a Raspberry Pi ESP32 Controller and Emulator in a single board.

**ESPuno Pi** is based on my original [RasDuinoHat](https://www.hackster.io/DitroniX/rdh-rasduinohat-sdk-concept-beta-arduino-raspberry-pihat-1a6a82) concept, allowing mixed technologies and offering flexibility to the maker and Home Automation community.  

Rather than being Quad-core ARM CPU based, **ESPuno Pi** is Espressif ESP32 based.
