## ESPuno Pi 

This **ESPuno Pi** is a new concept board based on the Epsressif ESP32 series MCU's but in a compact Raspberry Pi form factor.  This design follows on from the [**ESPuno Pi Zero**](https://github.com/DitroniX/ESPuno-Pi-Zero_WiFi-BT-Zigbee-Thread-60V) design.

**Raspberry Pi Emulator**

The **ESPuno Pi**, is a pin compatible Raspberry Pi ESP32 Controller and Emulator in a single board.  The Raspberry Pi GPIO's are controlled and driven from the ESP32-S3 or ESP32-P4, so bringing Raspberry Pi PiHat's and Breakout boards to the Arduino Embedded controller world.

**Launching in Feburary on KickStarter!**

A number of features have been included on the board in order to make this as flexible as possible for the STEM and maker community and also Multimedia users.

## ESPuno Pi variants

This **ESPuno Pi** will be available in two versions in order to extrapolate the unique features of the ESP32 series for both IoT Home Automation and industrial users.

**ESPuno Pi  - S3**

The first release of the ESPuno Pi is based on the ESP32-S3 in order to gain the maximum IoT Home Automation functionality and industrial use via the XtensaÂ® single-dual 32-bit LX7 CPU, with a frequency up to 240 MHz. This board will be known as ESPuno Pi  - S3.

**ESPuno Pi  - P4**

A version of the **ESPuno Pi** will be launched later around Q2, this being based on the new Espressif ESP32-P4 featuring the flexibility of having a 32-bit RISC-V dual-core processor for high performance systems, frequency up to 400 MHz, 32-bit RISC-V single-core processor for lower performance systems, frequency up to 40 MHz and multimedia functionality and industrial use. This board will be known as ESPuno Pi  - P4.

## WiFi and BT

Both versions of the **ESPuno Pi** feature the inclusion of a companion ESP32-C6 which will principally provide the WiFi 6, Zigbee, BT 5.3, Bluetooth LE and Mesh Thread 1.3 functionality. Standards IEEE 802.11b/g/n/ax; 2.4 GHz; HT20; up to 150 Mbps and 802.15.4 protocol. This MCU is a 32-bit RISC-V single-core processor, frequency up to 160 MHz.

## Security

Cyber security is important part of any design. All versions of the ESP32-S3, ESP32-P4 and ESP-C6 includes the following security features of 4096 bit OTP, AES, SHA, RSA, RNG and Secure Boot, Flash Encryption, Digital signature and HMAC module.

## GPIO, Interfaces and Connectivity

As with all variants of the **ESPuno Pi** GPIO flexibility is key. This not only includes 5V tolerant GPIOs but also 10/100 Mbps Ethernet, industry standard RS-485 MODBUS interface, OTG, Isolated GPIOs, ADC and DAC.

## Preliminary Overview

The below is a preliminary overview to the two **ESPuno Pi** variants.
